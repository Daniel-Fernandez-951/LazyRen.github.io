# Lazy Ren's Blog

## [About Me](https://lazyren.github.io/about/)

Hello, there!<br>
This blog is to post whatever I feel like to.<br>
I like writing & organizing stuffs as much as reading, so I've dedicated my times to make this blog.<br>
Before this, I used to have [tistory blog](https://lazyren.tistory.com/), but is no longer maintaining.<br>

Please feel free to contact me for any questions!
